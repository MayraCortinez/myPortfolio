## Description

This portfolio has been developed with Astro, a static site generator that enables the creation of fast and modern websites. The site's structure is responsive, ensuring it looks good on both mobile and desktop devices. Additionally, I have integrated Swiper.js to display my projects in an interactive and attractive manner.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **Smooth Animations**: Implemented with Swiper.js for fluid navigation between projects.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Implemented with Astro's `getStaticPaths` to generate static pages dynamically.
- **Props Usage**: Handling of properties within Astro components for modularity and code reuse.
- **Optimization**: Achieved 99% in performance and 94% in structure on GTmetrix.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: The main framework for building the site.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for responsive design and styling.
- **Swiper.js**: For animations and project presentations.
- **JavaScript**: For logic and dynamic interactions.
